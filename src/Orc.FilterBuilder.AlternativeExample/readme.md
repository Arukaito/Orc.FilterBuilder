Orc.FilterBuilder.AlternativeExample project is very close to Orc.FilterBuilder.Example similar. There is huge difference though. 
Such difference lies in the "schemaless" data source against which search is done. 

In order to inspire developers to use FilterBuilder for different types of data sources we deliberately selected zip code data set (media.mongodb.org/zips.json) which is being used by
MongoDb guys to illustrate their aggregation framework.
